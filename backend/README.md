# Backend API Notes

The `.NET` API is intentionally retained during the Supabase-as-API transition.

- Keep backend endpoints intact and buildable.
- Continue using this API as a fallback provider while frontend adapters migrate feature-by-feature.
- Current frontend provider default is `VITE_DATA_PROVIDER=supabase`.
